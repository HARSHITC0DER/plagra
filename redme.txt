# Paraphrasing Tool with Pegasus

This is a Python script that uses the Pegasus model for paraphrasing text. Given an input paragraph, it splits the text into sentences, paraphrases each sentence, and then combines the paraphrased sentences to generate a paraphrased version of the entire paragraph.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install transformers sentence-splitter torch
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paraphrasing-tool.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd paraphrasing-tool
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python paraphrase.py
Enter a paragraph of text when prompted.

The script will generate paraphrased sentences and display both the combined paraphrased paragraph and the separated sentences.

Example
Here's an example of how the script works:

  code
BANNER = """
    [Banner Text]
"""

# [Rest of Your Python Code]

# Comparison of the original (user_input) and the paraphrased version (paraphrase_paragraph variable)
print("\nOriginal:")
print(user_input)

print("\nParaphrased:")
print(paraphrase_paragraph)
